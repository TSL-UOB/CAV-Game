LMB for 
      - selecting existing vehicles
      - selecting existing waypoints
      - creating new waypoints for selected vehicle

RMB for

- Continue tutorial on holding object from where the mouse grabs it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVND_jo-kNo

- Movment should follow cursor ray 

- AVoid spawning actors on top of each other.

- When execute Scenario button is pressed 
    -  generate log and (DONE) 
    - convert to OpenScneario file and (giving me error of command not recognised) 
    - execute OpenScenario file.

- When terminate button is pressed kill OpenScenario execution.

- When OpenSCneario finishes execution set the terminate flag to true to put back everything as it was.


- STOPPED at trying another OpenScenario file, and terminating it more quickly than this. Trying to make the UE4 controls only apply to vehicles that are only ghosts.

ISSUES I FACED:
- The back slahes in the following file "/home/abanoub_g/UnrealEngine_4.26/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/Python3/Linux/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pkg_resources/_vendor/pyparsing.py", were causing errors for importing pkg_resources. Solution: Went through file and removed new lines after backslashes or removed back slash and made code one line.

- Cannot import numpy and getting a lot of issues with exeuting scenario runner through.  I tried to put numpy as a library in under Content/Python and that didn't work. I also tried to change the directory path so unreal uses the local python directory of the machine by adding this export UE_PYTHON_DIR=/usr/bin/python3 envrionment variable to .bashrc and that didn't change the path of the python being used by UE4. Solution: for now execute Python script independntly that monitors if a variable changes in a txt file. I fit does then it excutes scenario runner. If it changes then it kills scenario runner. This script would need to be run indepnetly of the game for now.
