# CAV-Game
This is a repository for the ongoing development of the Autonomous vehicles test generation game at the Trustworthy Systems Lab.  

The overall idea can be broken into three main tasks **1) Develop the Game:** to develop a game to allow players generate test scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) **2) Develop the monitor:** each game run needs to be monitored by a set of assertions representing the rules of the UK highway code to check if the AV or perhaps any other actors in the game have violated these rules **3) Develop the OpenScenario Converter:** In case any of the assertions are violated,  we need to generate an OpenScenario file from a game run that can be used to run the test on another autonomous vehicles.
